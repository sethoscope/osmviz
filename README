=== About ===

OSMViz is a small set of Python tools for retrieving
and using Mapnik tiles from a Slippy Map server 
(you may know these as OpenStreetMap images).

== Requirements ==

Python 2.6+ or 3.x
Pygame and/or PIL

There is not really anything here for installing
this into your python library. You can put it there
manually if you wish, or just add the src directory
to your PYTHONPATH.
